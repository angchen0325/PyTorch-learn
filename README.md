# PyTorch-learn

In this repository, I will be learning PyTorch programming by following the [official basics tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html).

I use both cuda (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and mps (Metal Performance Shaders) deivces for training and testing the models.
I also try to use Pytorch with two programming languages: python and C++. 
Python code is tested in *Jupyter Notebook*, and C++ code with the help of *cmake* by the usage of *CMkeLists.txt* file.
The python code is contained in the *root* directory, and the C++ code is in the *libtorch* directory.
