# PyTorch-learn

In this repository, I will be learning PyTorch programming by following the [official basics tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html).

I use both cuda (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and mps (Metal Performance Shaders) deivces for training and testing the models.
